# _Pig Dice Game_

#### By _Raphson Larry_

## Description

_This web application allows two players to play a game of Pig Dice._

## BDD
Player 1 and Player 2 both input their names, and click the start button.
On clicking start it goes to the game console.
Player 1 clicks roll button and dice rolls to generate a number between 1 and 6.
If player 1 rolls any number more than 1, the number is added to a round total.
Player 1 can either choose to hold and let player 2 play or go on playing until die rolls on 1.
If player rolls 1, no score is added and it becomes turn for player 2.
The process repeats for player 2.
When a player reaches a total of 100 or more the game ends and a winner page shows.
